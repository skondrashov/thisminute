This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You may see warnings about optional dependency fsevents. Those are normal.

## How To Build

1. cd tweet_tagger/
2. npm install
3. gulp less-css
4. npm start
    * if you have something running on localhost:3000 check your terminal and hit Y to run the site on localhost:3001

## How to Gulp
Right now the gulp file only compiles the less to css for us with webpack doing the live reloading of the page. You can run **gulp** in your terminal to watch for any changes to the less file. Every time the less is saved it will make a new CSS file.
